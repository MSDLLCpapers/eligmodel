Description: The eligmodel package facilitates the analysis of real-world data (RWD) by identifying and augmenting patients who
              satisfy key eligibility criteria from clinical trials. It assigns weights to RWD patients based on their estimated
              probability of meeting trial criteria and supports weighted analyses for time-to-event outcomes. The package also 
              includes tools for implementing and visualizing analyses through an interactive RShiny application. Methodological
              details are available at \url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34415774/}.
